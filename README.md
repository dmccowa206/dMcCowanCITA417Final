# About the game
This game is a small demo combining facets from multiple Unreal templates.

I took the shooter game mode from the first person template and applied it to the third person template to create a third person game mode where you could pick up a gun to shoot enemies. I then implemented a wave system and objectives that need to be completed to win the game. The objectives can spawn every other wave. Once you collect five of them, you win the game and get a victory overlay.
